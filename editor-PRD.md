Pixel Art Editor PRD
tl;dr
Create a web-based pixel art editor that allows users to design, edit, and export pixel art. The editor should be intuitive, lightweight, and highly responsive, leveraging Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and React. It should include core tools for drawing, layering, and exporting, while providing a delightful user experience.

Problem Statement
Pixel art creation tools often feel outdated, overly complex, or poorly optimized for modern web environments. Artists, hobbyists, and game developers need a sleek, intuitive tool to create pixel art that works seamlessly in any browser, with essential features and a fast, modern UI.

Goals
Business Goals
Attract a user base of hobbyists, artists, and indie game developers to increase traffic and engagement.
Monetize via a premium version offering advanced tools (e.g., custom palettes, animation support).
Build brand credibility by creating a pixel art editor that’s shareable and enjoyable.
User Goals
Create pixel art quickly and easily, with tools that feel intuitive.
Export art in common formats (PNG, GIF) for personal and professional use.
Share creations online with others or use them in game development pipelines.
Non-Goals
No AI-based generation tools in the initial version.
No native app development; this is strictly a web-based tool.
Advanced animation tools (e.g., frame-by-frame playback) are out of scope for the MVP.
User Stories
